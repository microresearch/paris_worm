* worming

- source texts - and strip these down!

- worm movement algorithm and how this is applied as needs to be across a grid (a grid of words but is normally long list

[[file:~/projects/ERD_modules/worm/docs/WORMALG/WORMALG.pde]] - but we need re-do vector code

- re-visit older text algorithms. see : /root/projects/earthcode/worm and diana:   /root/collected/diana/chapters/3_glass-crash:

isbrand.py for example...

worm through source text (by words or by lines)?
worm through substitutions tables for the POS?

- plan for worming in notebook. test on one source text. maybe also focus on word WORM itself!

- worm reworkings

/// menagerie of worms each with an alchemical/worm emblem

so 2 worms one for source, other for model worm through individual or
collated texts - one worms until it reaches appropriate part of speech
to match others, wormholes etc.
